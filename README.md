# ***🚀 Monster Kingdom 🚀***

I’m beyond excited (and slightly exhausted) to unveil my latest Unreal Engine 5 creation—Monster Kingdom! 👑 Enter a sprawling castle where danger hides behind every corner and monsters have clearly forgotten their manners. In this action-packed adventure, you’ll choose your weapon, face off against some seriously angry creatures, and try not to lose your sanity (or your health). The stakes are high, and the battles? Well, they’re fiercer than my morning coffee! ☕⚔️

### **Here’s what you can expect:**
- **⚔️ Third-Person Castle Combat:** Dive into epic battles as you fend off hordes of monsters in a castle setting. You know, the usual Tuesday afternoon.
- **🔄 Weapon Choices:** Will you wield the mighty axe or a sharp sword? The choice is yours, and trust me, they both have very different ways of making a monster feel very sorry! 🪓⚔️
- **👹 Advanced Enemy AI:** These monsters don’t just attack—they team up and strategize like they’re prepping for a game of chess. Good luck getting through that! 🤖💥
- **❤️‍🩹 Health & Damage System:** Every hit counts—attack or be attacked. And yes, your health bar will definitely not be your best friend here. 💔💪
- **🔨 Weapon Mechanics:** Swinging a massive hammer or slicing through foes with a sword has never felt so gratifying. Who knew virtual violence could be so satisfying? 💥🔪

### **Key Learnings:**
- 🎮 Mastered core gameplay mechanics using Blueprints and C++.
- 🏃‍♂️ Smooth character and monster movement for that extra dose of realism (or chaos, depending on how you play).
- 🎥 Developed fluid animations that bring characters and monsters to life—because who wants to fight stiff opponents, right?
- 🧠 Built an advanced AI system to keep players on their toes. Just what I need: more surprises!
- 🔄 Game restart functionality for those “oops, I definitely didn’t mean to walk into that monster” moments. 🎉

This project reminded me why I love game development—the thrill of overcoming challenges, the joy of creating something fun, and those moments where you just shake your head and laugh. I’m definitely looking forward to the next adventure (after some much-needed sleep)! 🌟💡
